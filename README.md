# UserColors
A [Known](http://github.com/idno/Known) plugin for multi-user installs - let users choose the colors on their profile pages!

### Caveats
May perform weirdly under themes that diverge sufficiently from default.

### TODO
* Should probably extend the colors to a few other views, like `/content/posts/username` and the fabled, mythical `/stream`.
* It is actually pretty difficult to pick colors that make the pager buttons readable. Which probably means: more colors coming!

### License
Same as Known
