# UserColors
A Known plugin for multi-user installs - let users choose the colors on their profile pages!

### Caveats
May perform weirdly under themes that diverge sufficiently from default.

### TODO
Should probably extend the colors to a few other views, like `/content/posts/username` and the fabled, mythical `/stream`.

### License
Same as Known
